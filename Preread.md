## Our Team

#### CEO: Rachel Evans

Her own medical history as well as a deep interest in public health and wellness gives Ansora a unique outlook on the supplement industry. 


#### CFO: Andra Buchan

Andra Buchan, our CFO, is an early entry Master’s student in Bioinformatics and an Olympic level diver with experience in genetic data analysis, handling DNA, advertising, design, and customer outreach. Her experience in an elite athletic environment and partnerships with companies allows Ansora to more effectively reach out to the athletic and active community, one of Ansora’s largest customer groups.

#### CTO: Sophie Tanker

Sophie Tanker, our CTO, is an early entry Master’s student in Bioinformatics with experience in both frontend and backend design. Her previous experience with patent preparation and prosecution has allowed Ansora to develop a long-term plan for protection of our intellectual property, ensuring best ROI for our investors.


## Timeline
Within the next month, Ansora hopes to achieve more customer discovery and find more target customer groups. Within the next five months, we hope to pinpoint specific vitamin receptor genes to be used in our microarrays, as well as order customized microarrays. 
At this time we hope to conduct further research into the efficacy of different vitamins, such as pills, gummies, or powders. In the following three months from there, we will obtain all necessary lab supplies, vitamins, and packaging materials needed as well as data structures for member storage. A year from now we plan to begin our trial period, relying heavily on feedback of trial customers. In the next two years, we hope to obtain a profitable customer base and several NIL partnerships with student athletes. 

## Budget
To afford the necessary lab materials, vitamins, packaging and advertising as well as support employees, we are expecting to have a budget at around 9 million. At this time, our highest priorities are:
Development of a custom microarray chip ($100k)
Our current estimates place the development of this chip at $100k for research and development costs as well as an upfront payment for 1,000 chips.
Warehouse space ($183k/yr)
We do not believe that it is necessary to purchase a warehouse at this time, but we do believe that we need space rental to allow for maximum efficiency in packaging and shipping operations. We have earmarked rental space in the Charlotte metro area to give access to Charlotte Douglas International Airport (air shipping) and Nordic Warehouse Inc (freight train shipping).
Staff costs ($1.5m)
In order to source the best and brightest bioinformaticians in the area, we will focus our staff recruitment efforts on the graduate programs at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and North Carolina State University. $1.5m will cover industry standard salary and benefits for 8-9 full time employees.
