### "A Vitamin Routine Based on your Genes!"
### Problem 
People are often not getting the nutrients they need to support their lifestyles, whether it be athletes, the elderly, new parents, or the general working class. People often seek food options that are convenient rather than options that will keep them healthy and full of energy.

### Our Company
Ansora uses microarray data that targets different nutrient receptor genes to create personalized vitamins. Customers will send a saliva sample and expression of many different genes such as vitamin receptor genes will be analyzed. A monthly supply of personalized vitamins such as calcium, iron, folic acid, Omega 3, Vitamins A, B, B12, C, D, K, and more will then be sent to customers. Here are some examples of genes that we will be targeting on our microarray:

| Vitamin      | Corresponding Gene | Gene Function |
| ------------ | ------------------ | --------------|
| Calcium      | CAS9       | Calcium sensing receptor |
| Iron   | HFE        | Modulates iron metabolism |
| Folate | MTHFR | Creates an enzyme that processes amino acids |
| Vitamin D | DBP-1 and DBP-2 | Transports vitamin D, influences T cell responses |
| Vitamin A | BCMO1 | Metabolizes vitamin A |
| Vitamin K | VKORC1 | Helps form blood clots |
| Vitamin B12 | TCN2 | Transports vitamin B12 |
| Omega 3 and 6 | FA2H | Modifies fatty acids, protects nerves |
